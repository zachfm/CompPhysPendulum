tuesday - 3 slides
	method
		explain algorithm
	error
		analytical soln
			for small theta, coskt
			for large theta, elliptic(k) (w/ scipy)
		
	nonlinear behavior
		k small to k big
		
visualization
	log-log scale determines power relationship w/ slope
	log-linear scale for exponential relationship
	
	phase-space plot
		plot v vs x
		
		conservative = closed loop and ellipse
			
roadmap
	tues - simple pendulum
	 	 +driving force -> route to chaotic pendulum
	thurs - double pendulum
	tues - DUE
